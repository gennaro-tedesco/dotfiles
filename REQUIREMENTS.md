# Requirements
I am making use of the following system programs:

|program      |scope        |
|:------------|:------------|
[vifm](https://vifm.info/) | file manager |
[bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat) | file preview |
[exa](https://the.exa.website/) | file and dir list |
[fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) | fuzzy finder |
[visidata](https://www.visidata.org/install/) | interactive csv manipulation |
[jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) | json parser |
[glow](https://github.com/charmbracelet/glow) | md preview |
[zenith](https://github.com/bvaisvil/zenith) | process list |
[dust](https://github.com/bootandy/dust) | disk space |
[navi](https://github.com/denisidoro/navi) | cheatsheet |
[ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) | grep improved |
[fd](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd) | find improved |
[delta](https://github.com/dandavison/delta) | diff improved |

Most of them are necessary as they are included in `zsh` functions as well as `neovim` plugins.

## Additional
Moreover I am using

|program      |scope        |
|:------------|:------------|
[macchina](https://github.com/Macchina-CLI/macchina) | sysinfo |
[hyperfine](https://github.com/sharkdp/hyperfine) | benchmarks |

Installation instructions depend on your operating system, however most programs can be easily installed by using the specific package manager of choice.
